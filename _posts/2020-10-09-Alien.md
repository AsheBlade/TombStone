Since about 2016, I always wanted to keepr record on things. Preserve and download, never trust Internet, because Internet does not hold information forever. 

Alien movies has always been one of my favourite movie series. Since I was not borned that early, I never have the chance to enjoy the orignal series. Even though I did download the first alien movie about one year ago, I still could not enjoy it due to my age. 

Here, I would like to preserve on these alien videos that are related to promethus and covenant. Those videos are not included in the movie, so I put them here in case I could not find them one day.

## David, A.I  - Prometheus & Covenant

This is a fan made video, I don't quite agree with the direction of this video (it is about AI). But it is still a very good fan made video.

## Quotes I like from the movies

> There is nothing in the desert and no man needs nothing.

-from movie  “Lawrence of Arabia”(1962)

> Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!

-from poem "Ozymandias" by PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY (Jan, 1918)

## Ozymandias

I do notice that Ozymandias is a great poem. I really enjoy it. The poem fits perfectly for the film, as it was filled with lonelyness and emptiness. 

> I met a traveller from an antique land,  
> Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
> Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,  
> Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
> And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
> Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
> Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
> The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;  
> And on the pedestal, these words appear:  
> **My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;**  
> **Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!**  
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
> Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare  
> The lone and level sands stretch far away.”  


**"Ozymandias" by Glirastes in The Examiner, London, Sunday, January 11, 1818, No. 524, page 24**
